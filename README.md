Hello world (02.02.26)
This is set to be a program that analyzes a songs key/scale and tempo. As a musician myself, I feel like it is very hard to find a songs chords and key when I want to play it. And that especially becomes an issue when that song is not known by many people. Or better yet, when that song is made by me or my friends. I mean to find a songs key you have to kind of analyze it pretty hard and you have to know a lot of theory. I know a little theory but its not enough. I will learn more eventually but the problem stays there for now. So I decided to write this program.

Planned features:
  Uploading files,
  Estimating the tempo,
  Key predictions

I feel like I will need many libraries (especially librosa) but we gotta start from somewhere I guess.
I plan to add many more things but these are first in line. So, let's start!
