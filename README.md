Hello world (02.02.26)
This is set to be a program that analyzes a songs key/scale and tempo. As a musician myself, I feel like it is very hard to find a songs chords and key when I want to play it. And that especially becomes an issue when that song is not known by many people. Or better yet, when that song is made by me or my friends. I mean to find a songs key you have to kind of analyze it pretty hard and you have to know a lot of theory. I know a little theory but its not enough. I will learn more eventually but the problem stays there for now. So I decided to write this program.

Planned features:
  Uploading files,
  Estimating the tempo,
  Key predictions

I feel like I will need many libraries (especially librosa) but we gotta start from somewhere I guess.
I plan to add many more things but these are first in line. So, let's start!

Well hello again! (23.02.26)
I know its been some time but I have been working on so many things on this project. I can pretty confidently say I did most of the things I wanted to.
So right now you can upload files, estimate the tempo with amazing quality and make really good key predictions.
I am still using streamlit for the frontend and the structure and I plan to continue doing so. Librosa is an amazing library too. I checked the library files and it was a whole lot of math and physics, I could understand almost half of it but there are some things I dont know yet. I am planning to learn some more tho.
Also I integrated an older project of mine into this one. It lets me download youtube videos to my computer as WAV files. I originally made it to burn my own cds but turns out it can have nmore uses than that. Now there are 2 tabs. One is youtube video downloader and the second tab is the original project. This is turning out even better than I expected. See you next time then!
